Resize the EFI partition before installing Windows
</p>

<p>
The tutorial begins from the first step of the Custom installation screen in Windows Setup (screenshot of this screen at the end of the article):
</p>
<pre><code>Select your installation target and make sure it has no partitions (except unallocated space)
Click the New and then the Apply button.
</code></pre>

<p>
You should now have four partitions: Recovery, System (ESP), MSR, and Primary.
</p>
<pre><code>Select each of the System, MSR, and Primary partitions in turn and click the Delete button to delete these partitions. Leave the Recovery partition in place.
Press Shift + F10 to open the Command Prompt
Type diskpart.exe and press Enter to open the disk partitioning tool
Type list disk and press Enter to list out your disks
Type select disk n where n is the number for the disk you want to install to as identified by the above command and press Enter
Type create partition efi size=550 where 550 is the desired size of the ESP in Mebibytes (MiB), and press Enter
Type format quick fs=fat32 label=System and press Enter to format the ESP
Type exit and press Enter to exit the disk partitioning tool
Type exit and press Enter again to exit the Command Prompt
</code></pre>
<p>
You should now be back in the graphical Windows Setup partitioning tool where nothing has changed since the last time you looked at it.
</p>
<pre><code>Click the Refresh button to detect your partition changes
</code></pre>

<p>
You should now have a disk with a default Windows Recovery tools partition, a 500â€¯MiB UEFI System Partition, and some unallocated space for your Windows installation.
</p>
<pre><code>Select the unallocated space from the disk list and click the New button to automatically recreate the MSR and System partition in the remaining space
</code></pre>
