= Notes =

== Git pull a different remote branch and checkout to it ==

`git switch branchname`

== Push commits from `tagA` until `tagB` ==

1. Make sure the remote branch is up-to-date until `tagA`
2. Reset the branch pointer to `tagB`: `git reset tagB`
3. Push like you do
4. Revert back to latest tag: `git reset latest`

== What does `git rm` do? ==

Seems like it's the same as

```bash
rm <file>
git add <file>
# Stages the deletion of the file basically
```

== Squash commits into one ==
