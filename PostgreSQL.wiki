== Simple commands ("Meta commands") ==

| Meta Command | Description     |
| `\dt`        | List all tables |
| `\du`        | List all users  |

== Concatenate ==

{{{sql
SELECT 
   first_name || ' ' || last_name,
   email
FROM 
   customer;
}}}

In this example, we used the concatenation operator || to concatenate the first name, space, and last name of every customer.

== SELECT with expressions (like arithmetic) ==

`SELECT 5 * 8;`

`SELECT 5 * 8 AS "Product"`

== Disable line wrap, and allow horizontal scroll ==

Assuming `less` is the pager being used, type `-S<Enter>` and this will disable wrap. Then, horizontally scroll with arrow keys.
