What's being covered:
	1. User Auth
    2. Working with data and APIs (Full CRUD)
    3. Model Manipulation
    4. URL-routing
    5. More: Full blown SPA, Django Rest Framework (DRF)

Other caveats and realizations:
	1. You have to install DRF manually (`pip install djangorestframework`)
    2. Create a superuser
    3. In `myapp/urls.py`, `router.register` should have `basename` attribute specified.
