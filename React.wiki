React is "Declarative programming". Whereas vanilla JS is "Imperative Programming."

== Imperative Programming ==

View

	<h1>0</h1>
	
Logic

	let num = parseInt(document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML)
	num += 1
	document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = num
	
== Declarative Programming ==

View
	
	<h1>{num}</h1>
	
Logic

	num+=1
	
	
== Packages to be used ==

* React
* ReactDOM
* Babel

We will write not JS, but JSX.

Babel will convert JSX to JS.
