Public IP:: Worldwide unique.
Private IP

Unique only on LAN. Can be used without registration.

is introduced to preserve the ipv4 addresses.

These are private IP examples:
    Class A: 10.x.x.x
    Class B: 172.16.x.x to 172.32.x.x
    Class C: 

Private IP must be converted to Public IP.

Write the advantages of NAT here.

How it works:

See from lecture.

=== Some examples solved ===

==== Fragmentation ====

Original packet size = 5000 B
MTU of current link: 1600 B
Assume header size = 20 B

Show the fragments with required fields.

data can be of 1680 B

{{{
5000
- 20
----
4980
1580 (1)
----
1820
1580 (2)
----
 240 (3)
}}}

| Frag # | length = 5000 | ID = A | fragflag = 0 | offset = 0                |
|:------:|---------------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Frag 1 | Length = 1600 | Same   | fragflag = 1 | offset = 1                |
| Frag 2 | Length = 1600 |        | flag = 1     | offset = 1580 / 8 = 197.5 |
| Frag 3 | same          | same   | same         | offset = 395              |
| Frag 4 | length = 260  | same   | flag = 0     | offset = 592.5            |

==== Routing/Forwarding Table ====

Routing Table:
| Network Addr.     | Subnet Mask     | Next hop/Interface |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 143.89.160.192/26 | 255.255.255.192 | I2                 |
| 143.89.160.128/25 | 255.255.255.128 | I3                 |
| 220.32.19.0       | 255.255.255.0   | I1                 |

Which interface will this ip lead to?
i. 200.32.18.201 -> Result is discard/drop
ii. 143.89.160.197 -> 197d = 110000101. Result is I2.
                    26 bits matches I2.
                    25 bits match I1.
                    So "longest prefix matching" with 192.
