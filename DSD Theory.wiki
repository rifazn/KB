* 11-13: The bits in a byte are numbered 7 to 0. Show a program that can input a 0 is a 1 or 0. If the bit is a 1, the program is to load the accumulator with an ASCII Y(yes). If the bit is a 0, the program should load the acc with an ASCII N (no). They yes or no asnwer is to be sent to out port 3.
